Cybascan provides a comprehensive, easy-to-use interface for users to view, confirm, and inspect transactions on Cybria blockchains. This includes Mainnet, & Testnet.

## About Cybascan

Cybascan allows users to search transactions, view accounts and balances, verify and interact with smart contracts and view and interact with applications on the Cybria network.

Cybascan is an open-source alternative to centralized, closed source block explorers such as Etherscan, Etherchain and others. As Ethereum sidechains and L2s continue to proliferate in both private and public settings, transparent, open-source tools are needed to analyze and validate all transactions.
